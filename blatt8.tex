% {\bf Hodgkin-Huxley model}

\vskip 0.8 true cm

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation.}
% Action
% potentials (aka spikes) are a dominant feature of nervous systems and
% play crucial roles in the computation performed by cortex, thalamus,
% cerebellum and associated structures.  The ionic mechanisms of action
% potential generation were described for the giant squid axon by Hodgkin and
% Huxley. The complete model they proposed is as following:
Hodgkin and Huxley proposed the following model for action potential
generation in the giant squid axon:
\begin{equation}
    c_m \tderiv{V(t)}=-I_{\Na}(V(t), t) - I_{\K}(V(t), t) - I_{\Leak}(V(t),t)
+ I_e
    \label{eq:HHM}
\end{equation}
where $I_{\Na}(V,t)$, $I_{\K}(V,t)$ are the sodium and potassium currents
which we already discussed.  $I_{\Leak}(V,t)$ is a passive leakage current due
to chloride and other ions:
\begin{equation}
I_{\Leak}(V,t)=\bar{g}_{\Leak}(V-E_{\Leak})
\end{equation}
with $\bar{g}_{\Leak}=0.3\,\mathrm{mS}$ and
$E_{\Leak}=-54.387\,\mathrm{mV}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Simulate the Hodgkin-Huxley model by numerically integrating the
        equations for $V$, $n$, $m$, $h$ (4-dimensional system of ODEs!). Take
        $c_m=1\,\mu\mathrm{F}$ and as initial values take:
        $V=-65\,\mathrm{mV}$, $m=0.0529$, $h=0.5961$, and $n=0.3177$. Make
        sure that the integration time step is
        short enough to obtain a stable and accurate solution (test several
        values).
  \item Use an external current $I_e=20\,\mu\mathrm{A}$ and plot $V$,
        $I_{\K}$, $I_{\Na}$ as functions of time. Which currents are
        responsible for different phases of action potential generation?
  \item Plot the firing rate of the model as a function of $I_e$ over
      the range from 0 to 200 $\mu$A. Show that the firing rate
      jumps discontinuously from zero to a finite value when the
      current passes through the minimum value to produce a sustained
      firing. (\textit{Hint:} use a membrane threshold for spike
      detection).
  \item Apply a pulse of a negative current with
      $I_e=-5\,\mu\mathrm{A}$ for 5 ms followed by $I_e=0$ and
      show what happens. Can you explain the results?
\end{enumerate}

% In the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, currents flowing through a large number of
% ion
% channels are modelled. The behaviour of single ion channels is more
% complex. Today you model the state of single channels
% using state diagrams and transition rates. In the end you should
% compare the fraction of open channels from your simulations with the
% respective fraction given by the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
% \vskip 0.8 true cm
% 
% \item {\bf Five state potassium channel model.}
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item General Methods
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Recapitulate Section 5.7 from the book of Dayan and Abbott. Make sure
%   you understand the state diagrams and the equations describing the
%   state transitions.  \item The transitions rates ($ms^{-1}$) we
%   need are the same we used for the Hodgkin-Huxley model before:
%   \begin{align*}
%       \alpha_n&=0.01\frac{V+55}{1-\exp(-0.1(V+55))}, &
%       \beta_n&=0.125\exp(-0.0125(V+65))\\
%   \end{align*}
% where $V$ is the voltage in mV.
% 
% 
% \end{enumerate}
% \item Assignments
% 
% We assume that the $K^+$ channel consists of four individual subunits,
% which all open and close independently. Thus the channel can be in
% five different states: with $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ subunits being
% open. Current is conducted only in the last state, where all subunits are
% open.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Implement a model of $K^+$ channels using the state diagramm
% shown in Figure 5.12. In general, you start with $x$ channels in
% some starting state (e.g. all closed). Then at each time step
% $\Delta t$ you draw for each channel a random number between $0$ and
% $1$ and determine via the state transition rates whether this
% channel stays in its state or changes to another state. The
% probability of changing to a given new state, is its transitions
% rate times $\Delta t$. Make sure that $\Delta t$ is small enough so
% that the probability is always much smaller than $1$!
% 
% \item Test your model by setting an initial membrane voltage and
% ensure that the channel state distributions reaches an equilibrium.
% Then set a new holding potential for some time and observe how the
% channel state distribution changes until the new equilibrium is
% reached. Finally you return to your initial membrane
% potential. Plot the number of open channels as a function of time.
% 
% \item Vary the total number of channels and produce graphs similar to
% the ones in Figure 5.12. Note that the figure shows actual currents, while
% you compare the fraction of open channels. What would you have to
% change to get currents as well?
