{\bf Background}

The tempotron, in analogy the perceptron, is a neuron that is able to
distinguish between different temporal input patterns. It should
respond with an action potential for some input patterns, but not for
others. Importantly, for all input patterns, the tempotron can receive
input from the same cells, but only the relative timing of these inputs is
different for different input patterns. Read the original paper
(G\"utig and Sompolinsky, 2006) to understand the details on the
tempotron algorithm.

{\bf The model neuron and its inputs} 

The tempotron is a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron that receives input
from $n$ cells. An input spike evokes a postsynaptic potential in the
membrane potential of the tempotron. The summed postsynaptic
potentials of all inputs define the membrane potential of the
tempotron: $$V(t)=\sum_i \omega_i \sum_{t_i}\kappa (t - t_i) +
V_{rest}$$ with $t_i$ being the spike time of the $i$th input cell and
$\kappa (t - t_i)$ being the normalized postsynaptic potential evoked
by an input spike (for $t-t_i \ge0$, otherwise $\kappa =0$): $$\kappa (t -
t_i)=V_0(e^{-(t-t_i)/\tau}-e^{-(t-t_i)/\tau_s})$$

$V_0$ is a normalization constant, so that the amplitude is given by
$\omega_i$. $\tau$ and $\tau_s$ are time constants for the membrane
and synaptic currents, respectively. They determinine the decay and
rise time of the postsynaptic potentials. For $\tau/\tau_s = 4$, $V_0$
equals $2.12$.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Implement a basic version of the tempotron. Start with very
   few input cells with different synaptic strengths $\omega_i$. Check
   a few voltage traces to ensure that your implementation is correct.
   \item Generate a set of random input patterns. Each pattern occurs
   within a time window of 500~ms. Each input cell fires only once
   per input pattern. The time of the input spike for each input cell
   is uniformly-distributed within the 500~ms window.
   \item Vary the synaptic weights and the number of input cells.
\end{enumerate}    

{\bf Tempotron learning} 

So far, the response of the tempotron does not change because the
synaptic weights are fixed. Now, we want to use a rule that modifies
the synaptic weights when a temporal pattern is presented. The goal is
that the tempotron produces an output spike for some patterns (`+'
patterns) but not for others (`-' patterns). To determine whether an
output spike is produced, we simply check whether the membrane
potential $V(t)$ exceeds a certain threshold for a given pattern.
Intuitively, the synaptic weights should be increased if we want our
tempotron to fire an action potential for a certain pattern.
Conversely, the synaptic weights should be decreased if we do not want
to fire a spike for a certain pattern. However, as the input patterns
mainly differ in the timing of the input, we need a sophisticated
learning rule. The tempotron learning rule is:
  $$ \Delta\omega_i = \lambda \sum_{t_i<t_{max}} \kappa
  (t_{max}-t_i)$$ where $\lambda>0$ is a learning rate and $t_{max}$
  is the time when $V(t)$ is maximal. Weights are only changed for
  incorrect responses of the tempotron. Weights are increased by
  $\Delta\omega_i$ if no spike was elicited (although there should have
  been one). Weights are decreased by $\Delta\omega_i$ if a spike was
  elicited (although there should have been none).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Train your tempotron on two patterns (one `+' and one `-'
  pattern). Compare the synaptic weights before and after learning.
  Switch the identities of the `+' and `-' pattern and learn again.
  
  \item Generate a larger training set and reproduce some results of
  G\"utig and Sompolinsky (2006).

  \item Change some aspects of the learning paradigm (e.g.~the
  temporal structure of the input patterns, the shape of postsynaptic
  potentials, the learning parameters,...) and examine the effect on
  learning performance.

  \item For what types of learning could the tempotron learning rule
  be used by the brain? Try to illustrate your idea(s) with
  simulations using the tempotron. Are there problems or weaknesses of
  the algorithm that need to be addressed by the brain?

\end{enumerate}
\textit{Create labeled figures for all your main findings
    and summarize your results.}
